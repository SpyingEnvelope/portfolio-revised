# Revised Portfolio
![An image of the website is displayed here.](/readme_image.png "This is an image of the website.")

Revised Portfolio is an updated version of my personal portfolio website, built with ReactJS. It uses React Router to handle navigation and display custom error pages for inactive URLs. Smooth animations are created using Framer Motion, while the design is styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with custom vanilla CSS elements.

The portfolio's design is based on space and solar systems. It is meant to look similar to the night sky, and the things people might see up there if they look carefully.

## Portoflio Access
The website can be accessed at https://gadcooper.dev/ . Feel free to look around. Fill out the form on the website to get in touch with me if you are interested. You can also shoot me an email using the links at the footer of the portfolio.

## Differences from Original
The original portfolio relied on using minimalistic animations to create a website that looked static most of the time. The revised portfolio utilizes Motion for React to a greater extent. It looks more modern than the original portfolio, and it utilizes animations often to create a unique, lively experience.

Due to its increased front-end complexity, this new portfolio also had to be carefully curated to different screen sizes. This makes it more dynamic, and its structure can change significantly from one screen size to another.

## Code Usage
The code for the website is shared here to allow others to use it as inspiration. Feel free to look around the code and use modified versions of it if you would like. I am strong believer in collaboration, and I hope my work can help others.
