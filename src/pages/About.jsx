            Hi, Iâ€™m Gad Cooper, a full-stack developer passionate about building
            software that empowers people and organizations. My passion led me
            to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, and I completed my
            studies in 2025, graduating with highest academic honors.{" "}

            <br />
            <br /> I try to create every software with love and care. In my off
